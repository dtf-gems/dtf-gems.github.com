      <h1>Deryls Testing Framework</h1>
<h2>
  What Is DTF?
</h2>
<p>
  DTF (Deryl's Testing Framework) is designed to be a modular framework for testing everything from shell
  scripts, to Ruby, to Rails apps.  DTF acts as an umbrella skeleton which is designed to incorporate multiple
  sub-gems each of which provides additional functionality to DTF. DTF is the master skeleton within which all
  other DTF gems integrate. These additional gems conform to the naming convention: dtf-blah where 'blah' is a
  shortname for the functionality that gem provides. The 'dtf' name by itself is reserved for the Master
  Control gem alone.
</p>
<h2>
  Internal architecture
</h2>
<p>
  DTF is designed in such a way that, with the master skepeton in place, one has only to load additional
  plugins from any available DTF extension gem to add additional functionality. This can be anything ranging
  from additional languages such as Ruby, Python, C, C++, etc, to testing methods and methodologies.
</p>
<h2>
  Current Status
</h2>
<p>
  DTF is 100% Alpha quality right now. (For those that don't know what that means, generally this means DTF is
  comprised of code with a vastly high potential for buggy code that may or may not even run. Consider DTF to
  be experimental until further notice. This README will be updated to reflect when DTF reaches a 'stable'
  quality.
</p>
<p>
  DTF will gladly, and willingly, review any Pull Requests sent to us, and incorporate them as they fit with
  the mission goal of DTF. Please bear in mind that DTF is a rolling Project. This means that the definition
  of what DTF is, and how that is implemented is not firmly etched in stone yet, so both of those can, and
  most likely will, change as time passes. If you can deal with that, please, by all means, feel free to
  contribute.
</p>
<h2>
  Branches
</h2>
<p>
  DTF has a branching and tagging topology as follows, and applies to DTF and <i>all</i> sub-module gems:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>
      master
    </strong>
    - This branch on the DTF control gem, and <i>all</i> dtf-<blah> sub-module gems is for *development*
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      stable
    </strong>
    - This branch on the DTF gem, and <i>all</i> dtf-<blah> sub-modules, is 'stable' or 'production' quality.
    Anything on this branch is to be considered safe and usable for everyday stuff.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      hotfix/<blah>
    </strong>
    - These branches are <i>stable</i> quality only. These are for running fixes to a particular
    stable branch and will usually result in generating a new version tag. For example, if
    the hotfix was applied against v2.3.4, then a tag of v2.3.5 would be generated once that
    hotfix was proven to be tested and stable.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      feature/<blah>
    </strong>
    - These branches are <i>development</i> quality only. This is for work on individual new features
    that <i>will</i> be rolled into DTF or sub-module gems.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      playground/<blah>
    </strong>
    - <i><b>These branches are alpha quality only</b></i>. These are for developers to work out either
    feasibilty of way-in-the-future ideas or to try something out that may, or may not,
    be incorporated into the DTF or its sub-modules.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>
    Playground branches are 100% to be considered throw-aways. They could disappear at any moment, and any
    user of the DTF framework that relies on these branches is on their own. NO SUPPORT will be provided of
    any kind for these branches, just so everyone is clear on that.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  All 'stable' production releases will be tagged. Only those releases will be tagged starting with a v, and a
  series like #.#.#  where the first '#' starts with 1 going to whatever, in progressive order.  This
  represents an industry standard versioning format. NOTE: v0.#.# is NOT considered a 'stable' release! This
  is normal in the industry for Projects just starting out. When a version is reached that we believe to be of
  sufficient quality to be denoted, and tagged, as our first Stable release, it will be marked as v1.#.# and
  NOT v0.#.#. The remaining '#' in the example denote our Minor, and Change '#' levels. For example, #.#.# is
  Major.Minor.Change_Number_within_Minor. This means the following. Given a 'v2.3.4' tag, this would denote:
  The 2nd official 'stable' release, the 3rd Minor change to the 2.x series, and finally, the 4th applied
  change within the 3rd Minor series.
</p>
<p>
  Until such time as the first official stable release is made, all v0.#.# tags up to but not including v0.5.0
  are of Alpha quality. Tags v0.5.# up to but not including v1.0.0 are to be considered Beta quality. This
  gives us plenty of room for Alpha <i>and</i> Beta work before an official 'stable' release within the
  numbering system. This applies to the DTF control gem, and <i>all</i> dtf-<blah> sub-module gems! Please
  bear this in mind!
</p>
<p>
  We are making this a uniform policy across all levels of DTF to ensure that what you think something is,
  really is when it comes to version numbers and what they mean. This <i>will</i> be a <i>strictly</i>
  enforced policy.
